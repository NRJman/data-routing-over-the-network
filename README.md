## Synopsis

[This web application](https://nrjman.github.io/data-routing-over-the-network/) for a desktops allows  you  to  **simulate computer  networks**  of  different topologies,  send  messages  and  measure  the  time  of sending messages in the network in the datagram mode and logical connection mode. **Hybrid Adaptive Routing (Delta Routing)** algorithm is used for  a  message routing.  It is possible to model networks of various configurations and test them, if you change the configuration.

## Motivation

This is my course work from university.

## Using

The main window of this application contains a panel for entering the initial data and network mapping, and also additional panels to display the shortest paths to the nodes for the selected node. You can add a new node by left clicking on display panel, or channel, by left-clicking at first to one node, and then to another. By double-clicking the left mouse button on the node you can
view its routing table. To get the message sending results from one node to another, you need to click on the Simulate button.
