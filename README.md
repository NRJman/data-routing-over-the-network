## Synopsis

[This web application](https://nrjman.github.io/data-routing-over-the-network/) for desktops allows you to **simulate computer networks**  of different topologies, send messages and measure time of sending messages in the network in the datagram mode and logical connection mode. [**Hybrid Adaptive Routing (Delta Routing)**](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/dheeraj/cs425/lec11.html) algorithm is used for a message routing. It is possible to model networks of various configurations and test them, if you change the configuration.

## Motivation

This is my university course work.

## How to use

The main window of this application contains a panel for entering initial data and setting network mapping. It also contains additional panels to display the shortest paths to nodes from the selected one. You can add a new node by left clicking on display panel, or channel by left-clicking at first on one node and then on another. By double-clicking the left mouse button on any node you can
view its routing table. You should click the middle mouse button on a node or a channel in order to remove them. To get the message sending results from one node to another, you need to click on a Simulate button.
