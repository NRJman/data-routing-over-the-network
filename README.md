## Synopsis

This web application for a desktops allows  you  to  **simulate computer  networks**  of  different topologies,  send  messages  and  measure  the  time  of sending messages in the network in the datagram mode and logical connection mode. **Hybrid Adaptive Routing (Delta Routing)** algorithm is used for  a  message routing.  It is possible to model networks of various configurations and test them, if you change the configuration.
